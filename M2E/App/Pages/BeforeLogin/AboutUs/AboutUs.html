                            Cautom started in 2014 with the goal of creating income generating avenues for the 600 millions youth of India. At the same time, we wanted to create an online application that appeals both to the Crowd Automation Requesters(clients) and Accepter(users). Today, we are a fully-fledged company with a variety of Crowd Automations Requesters distributing their tasks and taking advantage for the low cost and the crowd potential. 
                            We help people build, grow and support successful businesses by using crowd force concept. We manage crowd-based talent to deliver content, moderation, survey, data categorization, transcription solutions etc to enterprise clients worldwide.
                            We are growing. Since the inception of our idea of crowd automation, we have travelled a long path ahead. Currently we are developing our mobile apps and an exciting cloud platform, which we believe will enable us to raise our bars in becoming a next generation technical platform.
